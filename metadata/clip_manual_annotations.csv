20250101_000056,excited,2,alone,1,winter,late_night,grandmas_house,i remember feeling daunting and excited for the project to come. I was exhausted and feeling a lot of things
20250104_224628,joy,3,friends,1,winter,night,bar,i felt like a new person walking into the bar with all the clothes i got from japan.
20250114_191528,neutral,3,friends,2,winter,evening,home,i got caught filming. suddenly a wave of embarassment hit me. the political space has infiltrated my life.
20250124_005241,sad,1,alone,5,winter,evening,bedroom,i facepalmed and sighed. I have no idea what happened that day. all that remains is an unfamiliar face looking back at me.
20250128_191813,tired,4,friends,2,winter,evening,friends_house,"this was a memorable day. From me running to the bank to get some cash before the event, to playing mahjong with the girl who ghosted me, to a successful and celeboratory event, to an anxious new years celebration with friends from undergrad. I talked to new people and did not know how to continue conversations, feeling left out and out of place, and feeling like everyone was trying to find solace and company in this scattered world."
20250207_235830,excited,4,date,3,winter,evening,arcade,"looking back, this has significant impact on my life. The inside joke of ""what are we gonna do"", the tension filled car talk, and the kiss at the end. I still have quarters left of that date to this day that I need to get rid of."
20250301_215313,sad,1,alone,5,winter,evening,bedroom,"This is the first instance of my sadness that i remember vividly. it was when i planned a date around cooking for her, giving her my special Hungarian wine, and doing an asian snack tasting, only for her to walk out of my life mid-date. It was such an abrupt 180 that i could not understand what happened and it crushed my soul."
20250318_182102,nostalgic,3,alone,1,spring,afternoon,favorite_spot,"i don't remember how i ended up there again. Maybe it was to show one of my friends around as we were in the area. Nonetheless, I found this place last year summer before I broke up with my ex. I never got to show her the place even though i liked it very much. It brought a sense of isolation, but of peace. Of sadness, but of comfort."
20250328_151926,neutral,2,friends,2,spring,afternoon,university_quad,weather shows up a lot more than i expected. I caught most of the days it was really warm before jumping back to agony and cold again.
20250329_235911,anxious,1,friends,3,spring,evening,car,we were going to a club up north. it was a friend's birthday. i remember feeling incredibly anxious and hating the idea of anyone looking at me at that point. This feeling was unbearably strong because of the recent stalker situation at that time. i wanted to peel my skin off and walk away.
20250401_155047,joy,3,friends,2,spring,afternoon,comic_shop,"first time i stepped into first aid comics! this was the slow start of my obsession with magic the gathering. I remember going in to ask about it, and if they had any welcome decks. I already had the game night box at this point but haven't played it too much yet."
20250403_174103,calm,2,alone,3,spring,afternoon,home,the first time i made tea! i also uploaded my videos for the first time. I had just got my sunroom set up and felt really good about my space.
20250407_173354,overwhelmed,4,alone,2,spring,afternoon,boba_shop,"this was when i saw her again after the ghost. we needed to talk about the stalker situation, but i was very scared of seeing her and visiting her space again. I didn't know how I was gonna react or face her after what happened. "
20250408_152144,joy,4,friends,1,spring,afternoon,friends_house,this was an amazing afternoon! we got out of class and then my friend offered some sausages that he got. He got some bread out and some oil with the sausages and we had tea and chatted. I felt spoiled and it was great. I could also tell here that something was happening between the two of my friends.
20250410_215549,excited,3,friends,2,spring,evening,home,the first time i explicitly recorded magic the gathering! I think this was also the first time i showed my friend here about magic the gathering. it was an exciting night.
20250417_160235,excited,5,friends,1,spring,afternoon,home,class got cancelled so everyone came to my house to play magic the gathering! we then all went to play bowling! and then we ended the night playing catan at another friend's house while chugging cocktails! I can remember feeling very loved and surrounded by great friends.
20250501_023719,overwhelmed,5,alone,5,spring,late_night,bedroom,this was the beginning and the end of a chapter. we crossed a line that needed to be crossed but should never have been crossed. there was no going back after this. it felt so good.
20250503_130557,anxious,1,crowd,2,spring,morning,friends_house,"i never felt more out of place at a social gathering. i couldn't relate to anyone, and it felt like nobody really wanted to get to know me. everyone was from the same department except for me, so i had no common language with any of them. i could only talk to this cat. meow."
20250503_215040,joy,5,friends,1,spring,night,museum,one of the best nights ever! it was so much pure fun that whole night. just a bunch of schenanigans. 
20250504_223537,joy,5,friends,1,spring,night,home,a snapshot of the magic the gathering tournament i held! It was so great to see all of my friends from different walks of life getting to know each other. This was very cool.
20250507_211004,joy,5,crowd,1,spring,night,concert,oh my god. I was blown away. enchanted by her voice. This was the most beautiful experience i ever had. I felt so lucky to be alive and to be able to enjoy music and hear songs and appreciate art.
20250516_215223,sad,3,friends,2,spring,evening,home,my friend suddenly told me she was leaving to Los Angeles! This was our last time meeting of the year. It was pretty sad as we talked through where we are headed with our lives. I failed the pasta and thought I should get better at it.
20250530_231506,overwhelmed,5,friends,5,spring,evening,home,"this was my birthday party, followed by my birthday when i felt truly loved. It was a lot of emotions, and nothing captured my feeling of vulneratiblity and anxiety more than filming my view of everyone looking at me (and my friend) as they sang their song. People who knew me for years to people that just met me the first time that night."
20250602_001605,anxious,3,friends,4,summer,evening,home,"the last magic the gathering tournament. I was exhausted from hosting at that point, after hosting every week for a month along with my birthday party. It was great to have all these friends around me, but I was also just dead."
20250605_164830,neutral,3,friends,2,summer,afternoon,amusement_park,"I liked this shot because it was very mechanical, and it was a weird contrast to see us getting amusement and enjoyment out of heavy duty machinery and machinations. The g-force and thrill of these machineries have been diluted into family friendly fun. "
20250615_205708,tired,2,family,2,summer,evening,family_home,"what a jarring change of pace. I'm speaking chinese, and you can see the kitchen where I grew up. it felt really weird to come back to all of this after such a high from spring."
20250619_180402,neutral,2,family,1,summer,afternoon,theater,my sister's graduation! This was a pivotal moment for her as well. Seeing her graduation and the school just reminded me of my time there and my middle school graduation. It was very interesting to get this feeling of recursion.
20250624_123544,tired,3,family,2,summer,morning,plaza,"man again, what a jarring scene change. This was the beginning of the china arc. Abruptly seeing erik's home and living space that i will very soon get extremely acquainted with."
20250629_132248,tired,1,family,1,summer,morning,hotel,"family, politics, working, entrepeneuership, chinese consumerism, the hollow surface level understanding of architecture, disappointment, weird"
20250708_011632,overwhelmed,1,alone,5,summer,late_night,room,"my whole summer came crashing down, and suddenly i was thrown into whiplash. I had to adjust my mindset extremely quickly and had to brace for what was gonna happen for my summer. This all happened thanks to family."
20250711_015326,tired,1,alone,5,summer,late night,room,"I moved locations, but everything was still the same. Heck, it was worse because I wasn't with my friends. I was forced to go along with the pace of my brother, and It wasn't a sustainable pace."
20250715_200225,excited,3,date,2,summer,evening,plaza,"This was the second date I went on in China. It was also a date that I went on with a hot person. I went on a date with hot people before but this one I wasn't expecting. It changed my view on myself, especially with me getting the dating app."
20250719_214916,excited,3,family,2,summer,evening,room,"I bought my brother a piece of furniture, and he got increasingly more excited as the piece sat there. It felt good to give him something and to help him out. I felt appreciated, and I could feel that he was grateful for it too. I wish I could do that more in the future, especially as I got to know and see my brother's life more."
20250722_120100,angry,4,alone,5,summer,afternoon,tourist_attraction,"I got a culture shock for China. By going to a place I thought was traditional and had history, I was met with fake, ingenuine things. People were taking photos and not enjoying themselves, and that made me really mad and sad to see."
20250726_143140,neutral,3,family,4,summer,afternoon,classroom,"I was helping my brother out with his classes by taking photos and videos to use for his company. It was very tiring to be around kids, but it was great to witness the passion and the energy from my brother that I wouldn't get to see otherwise."
20250731_212453,excited,5,date,3,summer,evening,crosswalk,"This is a very unassuming shot that has no context, but I remember the day very vividly. I was on a date with one of the most beautiful girl I've ever met, and I totally loved her energy. I really wish I could've spent more time with her and gotten to know her more, and this date was nothing short of great. We went around thrift stores and acted goofy, but also talked and bantered. We got to know each other and spent some casual good time! "
20250802_201025,excited,5,date,2,summer,evening,plaza,"out of context, it sounds like I'm being harassed by tourist scammers, but these were my date's friends! They were all really nice and this date felt like a continuation of the great energy we had from before. Our conversations were great and we were getting even closer, and the way we acted to each other was also much cuter, like a shy high school couple hahaha. I loved it."
20250806_232538,overwhelmed,3,alone,5,summer,evening,hotel,"I was being vague in the video but I know i had a realization moment about my finances and where I want to be in life. Being in the company made me really gung-ho and want to work my way up to something, and to be financially literate and free. I felt an overwhelming surge of emotion to get out of this family backed hell and into somewhere I find meaningful."
20250813_201724,calm,5,alone,2,summer,evening,roads,"one of my favorite videos. It captures the environment, the mood, the place where I always want to be. In a small neighborhood of a towering city, with space all to myself as I explore to my pace. I could sing however I want, play whatever music I like in my ears, and enjoy the world as it is."
20250817_130357,overwhelmed,1,family,2,summer,afternoon,family_home,"I don't like my family. I feel overwhelmed when I'm there, like I don't know how to be myself. It's such a jarring contrast to how I experience myself around my friends or alone."
20250902_222531,sad,2,date,2,fall,night,plaza,"Goodbye. I knew it wasn't going to work out, but even our final day together was great. But even then, I never could get close to you. After our last date, you kept me at a distance, and while you told me all about your childhood and where you grew up, I still didn't know who you were."
20250911_142507,joy,3,alone,5,fall,afternoon,bedroom,"I'm home! I was very happy to be home despite the jetlag. I could definitely feel the shift in energy. Even on the first day back my friend came to pick me up and we had a nice dinner and caught up. I felt back in charge, in control again."
20250917_235926,angry,2,alone,5,fall,night,bedroom,"I felt angry that I wasn't capturing my days, especially since I'm back in Chicago and I felt like the things I was doing was more meaningful. It's funny because I constantly think of this throughout the year."
20250929_165756,tired,2,alone,2,fall,afternoon,theater,it was incredibly jarring to watch an art film after the hyperconsumption spree I went on in China. To go from a culture like that where everything is so fast-paced and forward to watching a piece that takes time to consider and watch was rough. I could feel that I couldn't watch these types of films anymore because my brain was corrupted by the hours of reels scrolling I did.
20251013_172740,joy,2,friends,2,fall,afternoon,roads,raymond the cat!
20251015_221821,excited,4,alone,5,fall,evening,roads,"I had a revelation while I was on a run the other day about where I was going with this project, and this was me voicing that feeling. I could feel at this point that the videos and what I record has shifted dramatically from my external environments to my own personal thoughts. It felt like a change I wasn't expecting myself to embody. "
20251019_165145,joy,3,alone,5,fall,afternoon,kitchen,"it was a small victory for me, that I don't think I ever documented before. I was getting into cooking to save money for financial reasons, and it made enough of an impact for me to want to celebrate this moment."
20251022_234229,joy,4,alone,5,fall,evening,bedroom,Another celebration of myself! I was giving myself space to appreciate the efforts I was putting into keeping myself on top of things. It's great to hear myself talk about myself like that. 
20251026_015947,excited,4,alone,5,fall,night,bedroom,"AGAIN it's about a girl! This was the first time I explicitly talked about a girl, and it's a girl I never would see ever! My life revolves around romance!"
